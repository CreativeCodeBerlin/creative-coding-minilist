# What is Creative Coding?

Creative Coding is a loosely defined term used to describe a wide range of artistic practices that use computer code as a medium. Creative Code typically distinguishes itself from regular coding by the fact that it doesn't follow pre-defined specifications to solve problems for a user, but rather aims at expressing ideas and concepts.

# Where does it come from?

There is a rich history of artists using computers as a tool, going back all the way to the early 1960s. People like [Vera Molnar](https://vimeo.com/372579247), [Frieder Nake](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/agent/68), [Lillian Schwartz](https://vimeo.com/98960229), and [Manfred Mohr](http://www.emohr.com/), some of them still active today. They used computer code to generate complex visuals, drawings, animations, or music. To learn more about the history of computer art you can read [*When the Machine Made Art*](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/when-the-machine-made-art-9781623562724/) by Grant D. Taylor.

# Why this document?

Getting started in any new field can feel overwhelming. This page is the opposite of the "awesome" curated lists that are popular on Github. Rather than an exhaustive compilation of every resource on the internet, it is deliberately incomplete. For each of the categories below, we hand picked one tool, one artist, one book, and one website to get your started on your journey.

Let's get going!
